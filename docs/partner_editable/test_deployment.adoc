=== Grant permissions to the Hail 0.2 Service Catalog Portfolio

Open the AWS Service Catalog console and select the “Hail Products” portfolio

Click on the “Groups, roles, and users (1)” tab and then click the “Add groups, roles, users” button”.

image::../images/testing/Picture2.png[Picture2,width=648,height=439]

Select the IAM users/roles/groups that you want to grant the ability to launch Hail clusters or notebooks. For example, I’m giving access to an IAM user below. Even though you launched the catalog, you still need to explicitly grant yourself permissions this way. So don’t forget to grant yourself access.

=== Launch a Hail Cluster

Return to Service Catalog and click on the topmost “Products” link on the left gutter. Users who are not service catalogs administrators and visit the service catalog in the console will be taken directly to this location.

Click on the stacked Dots on the “Hail EMR Cluster” product and choose the “Launch Product” button.
